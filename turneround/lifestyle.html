            <span class="articlesignature">Balmit Kaur</span></p>
          <p class="Article">The changing of the seasons brings a kaleidoscope of colours into our scenery, piles of falling leaves to jump into, Halloween and unfortunately the cold… Although the Canadian climate brings us variety, it also brings sickness, and for us high school student, what could possibly be worse than missing weeks of school just to recover? Nothing really, unless you enjoy playing catch-up with a pile of homework that is. So here are a few helpful tips on how to avoid catching the bug this year!</p>
          <p class="Article">First and foremost, MAKE SURE TO KEEP WARM! This cannot be stressed enough how important it is to stay warm. The weather right now is unpredictable, it changes in an instant and therefore, you don&rsquo;t want to be caught in the cold dressed inappropriately. This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean to bring out the big, furry winter coats, but dressing in layers will do: a sweater and a light jacket. If the weather is pleasant, taking them off and carrying them around isn&rsquo;t too much of a hassle, and it&rsquo;s definitely the better alternative than standing outside waiting for your ride or bus shivering in the cold.</p>
          <p class="Article">Secondly, WATCH OUT FOR THE SYMPTONS! A cold or flu usually starts with a sore or scratchy throat, therefore, if you can stop it in its tracks at that point you&rsquo;ll be cold free! To fight a sore throat, one of the best things to do is to gargle with warm salt water. This helps to clear your throat from whatever is bothering you and chases away the virus. Acting immediately is very important to getting rid of a cold. The moment your body starts to ache or you feel lethargic and sickly, take something like Tylenol for flu and colds and sleep; rest is vital in order to fight off a virus. If you prefer natural remedies to cure your cold, instead of filling your body with medicines, try to substitute cough medicine and cough drops for honey! Eating a tablespoon of it once or twice a day will help to soothe your throat. If you want it to be more effective, stir it into some lemon tea, which will also help your body to get the vitamin C it needs.</p>
          <p class="Article">Lastly, GET SOME REST! As was mentioned before, rest is imperative. If you feel that your condition has worsened, taking a day off from school right off the bat is a much better option than straining your body and then eventually having to stay home for more a few days. The body needs energy to fight the germs and if you aren&rsquo;t getting enough sleep, it won&rsquo;t be able to do its job.</p>
          <p class="Article">If your symptoms start to become worse (i.e. you are throwing up or developing a fever), make sure to see a doctor immediately. This is because they aren&rsquo;t the usual symptoms of a cold and you may require antibiotics, which only a doctor can prescribe, in order to rid yourself of the virus.  The earlier caught the faster you will recover. <br />
            So I hope you stay healthy this season, and if not, hopefully this article will help you to recover faster!</p>

          <p><strong class="articletitle">GETTING INVOLVED ISN&rsquo;T HARD </strong><br />
            <span class="articlesignature">Turneround Staff<br />
            </span><br />
            <span class="Article">Becoming engaged in our community and school is a great way to not only get to know more people and explore new skills, but as we approach our last years of our education prior to post-secondary education, we also need to find ways to diversify our resume. Whether it is for college forms, apprenticeship, job interviews or university applications, many future employers and admissions offices are looking for people with more than just the stellar grades. <br />
              So Turner Fenton, Turneround has compiled a list of places that are always seeking fresh new faces to become parts of their teams and will allow you to make your resume stand out amidst the competition.<br />
              <strong><u>Extracurricular activities inside of school</u></strong><br />
            What better way to start than by getting involved in a place already near and dear to us? Here are a list of clubs and activities at school that you could get in contact with and help out!</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Amnesty International:</strong> Amnesty International is a club that focuses on raising awareness on issues regarding human rights and fundraises throughout the year to aid such causes with the broader Amnesty International Organization. If you are interested in aiding those less fortunate than us, this could be the place for you! (Amnesty International meets every Thursday after school in the French Hallway in South). </li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Earth Core: </strong>Do you have a passion for the environment? Do you want to work towards making our world a healthier place for our generation and those to come? Earth Core is the place for you! Join Earth Core and engage in initiatives that will make our school a cleaner place! (Earth Core meets every Thursday after school in room 238.) </li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Historical Expressions:</strong> No, this is not just a club about history! IF you have a passion though, for historical events, and want to aid in keeping those nostalgic memories of our world&rsquo;s past alive, join Historical Expressions. (Historical Expressions meets every Tuesday after school in room 328 for the next meeting!)</li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Integrated Arts Council: </strong>You guessed it – IAC is all about the Arts. With a more diverse focus on all the art forms (drama, dance, and of course visual plus many more) this year, come to room 324 every Tuesday after school to engage in some artistic fun, or a skill-developing workshop!</li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Peer Tutors:</strong> If you love teaching, or just spreading knowledge, contact Peer Tutors, to spend just one or a couple lunches a week aiding other students with their academic endeavours!</li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>SAFE:</strong> Are you all about safety? Are you against bullying? Are you all for equality for the LGBT community? Then join the Student Alliance for Equality on Wednesdays after school in the History 329 to discuss events that promote a safer environment in schools, and for the LGBT community!</li>
      </ul>
          <p class="Article">Remember Turner Fenton – these are just a few of the clubs here at our school! If you are interested in things outside of these remember to listen to announcements or check out the announcement boards and stay tuned to Turnaround&rsquo;s releases for more information! <br />
              <strong><u>Extracurricular activities outside of school</u></strong> <br />
            If you want to get involved in more than one way and want to find out what&rsquo;s happening outside of school keep reading! Below are some organizations that are really easy to join, and are always happy to see new members eager to help!</p>
          <ul>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Heart and Stroke Foundation:</strong> Yes, you may see the ads for the Lottery on TV but HSF is more than just about giving away prizes and money. HSF raises awareness about Heart Disease and Stroke, which are the leadings causes of death in today&rsquo;s society, by attending events and giving presentations and workshops to the public. If you are a people person, love to speak or love to do &ldquo;behind-the-scenes&rdquo; work at and office, contact the HSF online at their website which you can access easily through Google (type in Heart and Stroke Foundation) to learn more!</li>
            <li class="Article"> Other big organizations like HSF include Free the Children, Red Cross, Sick Kids etc. In fact if you go to Google (for our tech-savvy generation) and type in &ldquo;volunteer opportunities&rdquo; a list of places you can volunteer pops up! There are so many options! </li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>The Hospital:</strong> Though a tedious process, applying to volunteer at a hospital could be great experience especially for those who are interested in a future in medicine or science. Even for those of you who just like helping people, check out applications online at a hospital or health care centre near you! You would even talk to your family doctor about volunteering at their clinic! </li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Tutoring centers</strong> like Kumon, Sylvan, UCMAS, Oxford, Learna etc. also sometimes accept volunteer tutors depending on the centre location&rsquo;s owner. Contact a center near you to find out! </li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>Religious Institutions:</strong> For those of you, who are already affiliated with your own place of worship, talk to their staff about helping out once in a while. Since you already attend, it will be easy to approach familiar faces! </li>
            <li class="Article"><strong>The Library:</strong> Interested in volunteering for the library? You would be surprised at the wide range of volunteer positions available<strong>such as </strong>Reading Buddy, Program Assistant and a member of the Teen Library Council. &nbsp;For more information, contact your local library or visit the Brampton library online! </li>
            <li class="Article"><strong><u>Your Parent&rsquo;s Work:</u></strong> Sometimes, your parent&rsquo;s or your guardian&rsquo;s office or workplace allows students to come in and help out! Talk to your parents or guardians to find out - It&rsquo;s super easy to do this one! </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="Article">Remember, that you don&rsquo;t have to volunteer at a reputable organization to be noticed! Even the smallest bit of help on a weekend at your local park, can get you to start networking (as that is so important these days!)! Always keep an open mind, and be ready to do some of the &ldquo;grunt&rdquo; work, but if you persevere you may end up with that &ldquo;top-notch position&rdquo; by the end of that ladder&rsquo;s climb! </p>

          <p><strong class="articletitle">PlanYouth at TFSS</strong><br />
            <span class="articlesignature">Parnika Sharma</span></span><br />
            <span class="Article"><img src="pics/3.gif" width="180" height="148" align="right" /></span></p>
          <p><span class="Article">Do you know what happened on October 11th this year? The United Nations declared October 11th to be the first &ldquo;Day of the Girl&rdquo;, in cooperation with one of Plan International&rsquo;s many initiatives – <em>Because I am a Girl</em>. Though Turner Fenton was unable to celebrate, this will not be the case next year. PlanYouth at TFSS is a new club that will be fundraising and raising awareness about Plan initiatives for the rest of the year, so join now!<br />
            Plan International is a global organization that advocates child rights and has a mission of helping children. Plan has three main campaigns; <em>Learn Without Fear, Universal Birth Registration</em> and <em>Because I am a Girl.</em><br />
            <em>Learn Without Fear </em>is a global campaign targeted towards creating safer schools in developing countries that are open to all children regardless of gender or age. This campaign has protected over 390 million children from being affected by violence in schools – a place of learning that should be their safe haven.<br />
            <em>Universal Birth Registration </em>allows mothers to get birth certificates for their children. While this may seem insignificant, in reality it protects children from child trafficking, child marriage and forced conscription. It also allows children to vote when they are older, obtain an education, get a job, get legally married, and inherit land.<br />
            <em>Because I am a Girl</em> is a campaign towards equality for girls. It provides girls with the opportunity to get an education, avoid forced marriages and battle against female oppression. <br />
            PlanYouth is one of the branch groups of Plan International. It is a group for youth who want to join the Plan organization and help make a difference. If you would like to join the PlanYouth group at Turner, like their Facebook page &ldquo;PlanYouth at TFSS&rdquo; or send them an e-mail at tfssplanyouth@gmail.com! </span></p>
